I am the Multimedia and Web Services Librarian, Professor, for the [Ursula C. Schwerin Library](https://library.citytech.cuny.edu) at the [New York City College of Technology](https://citytech.cuny.edu) of the [City University of New York](https://www.cuny.edu).

My research interests include mobile web usability, digital privacy, podcasting, and more. I've written a number of [publications and presentations](cv.html), including the books, [*Usability and the Mobile Web*](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937668047) and [*Podcasting: A Practical Guide for Librarians*](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1259038141).

I oversee the City Tech library's Multimedia Resource Center, the media collection, and website. 

Originally from Whitesburg, KY, I reside in Brooklyn, NY. I earned my Master of Library Science and Master of Information Science from Indiana University, Bloomington. 

While not in the library, I enjoy spending time listening to heavy metal vinyl, cooking vegan meals, and cycling.
